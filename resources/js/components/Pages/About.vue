                            I studied art history and design, my goal was to become an art teacher or architect.
                            I had a lot of fun working on new designs and learning about the different art movements and artistic developments.
                            Even though I enjoyed experimenting with different mediums and art styles
                            I did not see myself working full time as a designer so I decided to go in a different direction.

                        <h2>My journey in web development</h2>
                        <p class="mb-4">After working 2 years in Horeca I decided to try a new career path,
                            I always been interested in computers and after seen my husband busy with code
                            (he's a tech-lead at <a href="https://socialblue.com/get-to-know-our-backend-developer-maarten-tolhuijs/" target="_blank">Social Blue</a>),
                            I became really interested and found the idea of building my own website very exciting.
                            I  signed up to a coding bootcamp in Amsterdam called <a href="https://codaisseur.com/" target="_blank">Codaisseur</a>
                            where I learned all the basics about web development.<br>
                            It wasn't until I got my first job at <a href="https://www.growingminds.nl/" target="_blank">Growing Minds</a>
                            where I fully started to get what web development is all about.
                        </p>
                        <p>At Growing Minds I have learned to build dynamic forms with dynamic content for our multiple clients,
                            I been able to contribute to the main product which is <a href="https://growingminds.nl/products/formulieren-bouwen/" target="_blank">Form Suite</a>.
